## Description

### AI
<!-- Provide a brief summary on how the solution was derived using AI Technique -->
The code employs Detectron2â€™s Mask R-CNN model for advanced object detection and instance segmentation. It processes images to identify objects and generate detailed masks. To improve the detection of smaller objects, the approach includes resizing the images and applying dilation operations. The final output integrates these masks with the original images, enhancing visibility and saving the refined results for further analysis.


### Non_AI
<!-- Provide a brief summary on how the solution was derived using Non_AI Technique -->
By employing image processing techniques such as blurring, thresholding, and contour detection, this solution effectively identifies and visualizes objects within images. This approach is both practical and efficient for object detection tasks, achieving reliable results without the need for advanced AI models.
